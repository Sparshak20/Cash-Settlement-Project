About the Project: 

I have created a user-friendly web application that simplifies the process of splitting money for groups of people. This application has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a smooth user experience. Users can create groups and indicate the amount to be paid to different individuals, making the process of splitting expenses much more manageable.

To ensure maximum efficiency, the application utilizes the Heap Data Structure algorithm to calculate and suggest the minimum number of transactions required to resolve expenses. This feature streamlines the payment process and eliminates any confusion that may arise while splitting the bill.

Overall, my web application is designed to make group expense management more straightforward and hassle-free. By using this application, users can save time and effort and ensure that everyone in the group pays the right amount without any inconvenience.
